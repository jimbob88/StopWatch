## The Stopwatch's History
Whenever a user completes a function, for example hits the pause/unpause button then it will be recorded along with the current date and the name of function (+ the title). The only issue with the history, is that if multiple instances of the program run at the same time their history will be overlayed within the text file!

## Title Changing Feature
The title can be used to differentiate different instances so one can look back through their history more easily.
